This environment is the boss room for the second boss in my capstone game, Elyria, ashen Queen of Crimson who is a vampire that has been living in this city for centuries. 

Since the environment is based around the character, I have included her in the screenshots. The goal of the environment was to put the player on edge using dim light; the only light sources being small rays of moon light through some windows, and candles on the sides. I also added some fog sheets to fit the theme and mystique of the character.

Much of the inspiration for the environment itself comes from the Cathedral of Pontiff Sulyvahn from Dark Souls 3, although I completely changed the lighting to make it darker and more gritty.

For the SMBPs, I combined some stairs and pillars to make square platforms, which I then used to make an even bigger pillar SMBP. The lights placed above candles in the SMBP are also adjustable. And then I also have some other stuff like barrels put together, chairs, etc.
